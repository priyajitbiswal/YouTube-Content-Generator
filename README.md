## Customization

You can modify the prompts in `prompts.py` to:

- Change the writing style
- Adjust the tone of generated content
- Add specific requirements for your niche
- Modify the AI model used in `groq_api.py`

## API Model

This application uses the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model from Groq. You can change this in `groq_api.py` if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Error**: Make sure your GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is set correctly
- **Import Error**: Ensure the `groq` package is installed with `pip install groq`
- **Rate Limits**: Groq has free tier limitations; consider upgrading for heavy usage
